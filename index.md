# Learn more. Do more. Share more.
SANS asked me if I had a Cyber Resolution for 2020.  I initially chucled about "Cyber Reasolutions", but in a world where you can buy a "Cyber Truck", maybe Cyber Resolutions are actually a thing. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  

Anyhow, today, January 1, 2020, after forgetting about the email for almost 3 weeks, I gave it some thought and responded with a motto instead of a resolution:

> My personal ~~moto~~ motto for this year is “Learn more. Do more. Share more”.  I’m going to sharpen some existing skills and develop some new ones so I can create some useful tools. Then I’m going to share what I learn and create along the way via GitHub, blogs, social media, talks, and webcasts.

After realizing I mistyped "motto", I sent a quick correction, and then created this site. Beyond this page, I've not put much thought into how I'm going to live out this motto, but I hope to share the process of developing my process, as well.  Hopefully we can all learn, do, and share together.
